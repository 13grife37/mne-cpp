\section{Product application}
To describe what possible usages the software has the aspects of scope, potential target audience and operating conditions will be outlined. 
\subsection{Scope}
The application will be used for medical purposes especially in diagnostic scenarios. The framework is already used to do research on certain brain-functions and diseases (e.g. epilepsy). The program  will contribute to the functionality of the whole framework. The library will be used with the front-end-applications already existing, mainly MNE-Scan.\\
A second application is the usage in new programs based on the library. The user can rely on the functionality and build new software for his needs.


\subsection{Potential target audience}
The main target group for the project consists of scientist and physicians that want to research and analyze the behavior of the human brain. It is already being used in the babyMEG lab at the Boston Children's Hospital to acquire and process MEG/EEG data of infants.

\subsection{Operating conditions}
Because of the essential real-time-functionality the software has to do the SCDC (\ref{scdc}) "offline" (not during the displaying process). The Interpolation has to be "online" (during the displaying process) due to the changing input and the live output.
