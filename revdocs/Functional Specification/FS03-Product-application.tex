\section{Product application}
To describe what possible usages the software has the aspects of scope, potential target audience and operating conditions will be outlined. 
\subsection{Scope}
The application will be used for medical purposes especially in diagnostic scenarios. The framework is already used by scientist to do research on certain brain-functions and diseases (e.g. epilepsy). The program  will contribute to the functionality of the whole framework. The library will be used with the front-end-applications already existing, mainly MNE-Scan.\\
A second application is the usage in new programs based on the library. Scientist and physicians can rely on the functionality and build new software for their needs.
