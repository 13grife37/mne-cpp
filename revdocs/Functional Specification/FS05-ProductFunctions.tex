\subsection{User functions}

	\begin{aims}
	
		\item[F111]	The user can access the implemented features as part of MNE-Scan.
		\item[F112] Any desired surface mesh and set of sensor data, selected by the user, can be used as input data for 							further calculations.
		\item[F113] A preferred subset of vertices can be selected, to perform distance calculations on. 
		\item[F114] The user is able to select a threshold for identifying all relevant vertices while interpolating. 
		\item[F115] As part of MNE-Scan/Disp3D all graphical options are available to the user, meaning e.g. different 								coloring and rotation of the object.
