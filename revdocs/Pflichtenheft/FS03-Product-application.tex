\section{Product Usage}
To describe what possible usages the software has, the aspects of scope, potential target audience and operating conditions will be outlined. 
\subsection{Scope}\label{3_1_scope}
The application will be used for medical purposes especially in diagnostic scenarios. The framework is already used to do research on certain brain-functions and diseases (e.g. epilepsy). The program  will contribute to the functionality of the whole framework. The library will be used with the front-end-applications already existing, mainly MNE-Scan.\\
A second application is the usage in new programs based on the library. Users can rely on the functionality and build new software for his needs.


\subsection{Potential target audience}
The main target group of the project consists of scientists and physicians who want to research and analyze the behavior of the human brain. E.g. MNE-CPP is already being used in the babyMEG lab at the Boston Children's Hospital to acquire and process MEG/EEG data of infants.

\subsection{Operating conditions}
Because of the essential real-time-functionality the software has to run the SCDC (\ref{scdc}) "offline" (i.e. not during the displaying process). \\
On the contrary, the interpolation has to be "online" (during the displaying process) due to the changing input and the live output.
