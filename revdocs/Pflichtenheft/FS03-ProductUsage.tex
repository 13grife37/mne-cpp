\section{Product Usage}
To describe what possible usages the software has, the aspects of scope, potential target audience and operating conditions will be outlined. 
\subsection{Scope}\label{3_1_scope}
The application will be used for medical purposes especially in diagnostic scenarios. The MNE-CPP framework is already used to research on certain brain-functions and diseases (e.g. epilepsy). The real-time mesh utilities will be used by the front-end-applications already existing, mainly MNE Scan.\\
Furthermore, the software can be reused by other developers for additional enhancements or modifications.


\subsection{Potential Target Audience}
The main target group of the project consists of scientists and physicians who want to research and analyze the behavior of the human brain. E.g. MNE-CPP is already being used in the babyMEG lab at the Boston Children's Hospital to acquire and process MEG/EEG data of infants.

\subsection{Operating Conditions}
Because of the essential real-time-functionality the software has to run the SCDC (\ref{scdc}) "offline" (i.e. not during the displaying process). \\
On the contrary, the interpolation has to be "online" (during the displaying process) due to the changing input and the live output.
