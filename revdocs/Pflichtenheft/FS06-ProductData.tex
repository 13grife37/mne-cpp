\section{Product Data}
The following points depict the data used in the program.
	\begin{aims}
		\item[D11] \textit{Meshes:} A mesh consists of vertices which represent a 3D model, most likely that of a brain ,scalp (head) or sensor helmet. The mesh is included in the input.
		
		\item[D12] \textit{Distance matrix:} The matrix consists of values which describe the distances between the vertices. The distance matrix is calculated from the mesh.
		
		\item[D13] \textit{Sensor array:} The sensor array contains the sensors positions which are represented by vectors. The sensor array is included in the input.
		
		\item[D14] \textit{Measurement data:} The measurement data is represented as a matrix. Every row holds one signal curve of a sensor. Thus, every column defines a certain point of time.
		
		\item[D15] \textit{Intensity vector:} The intensity vector is a set of values that specify the neurophysiological activity of the vertices.
