\begin{aims}
	\item[S11] \textit{Real-time processing:} Once the software is initialized, it should process the input data in real-time.
	
	%\item[S12] \textit{Low latency:} In order to provide the real-time functionality, the latency has to be kept as low as possible.
	
	\item[S12] \textit{Efficiency:} The program should work on normal hardware and be efficient enough to deliver its performance on most setups. 
	
	\item[S13] \textit{Sturdiness:} The software should be independent of the executing hardware.
	
	\item[S14] \textit{GPU-Usage:} For maximum efficiency some operations should use the GPU instead of the CPU for more parallelism, whenever possible.
