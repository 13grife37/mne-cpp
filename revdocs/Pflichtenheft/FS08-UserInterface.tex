\section{Graphical User Interface (GUI)}

Due to being an extension of the existing project MNE-CPP, no new GUI is needed. Nevertheless the new features must be integrated into Disp3D and MNE-Scan. \\

Disp3D acts as a test environment with a basic interface. It loads sample data and features various graphical options. \\
The new functions are executable through the GUI of Disp3D. For that, a new item is created to expand the existing product. (\ref{integration}) \\

The complete MNE-CPP project consists of 3 big subprograms, namely MNE-Scan, MNE-Analyze and MNE-Browse, which can be selected by a main launcher. Alongside Disp3D, the new features are executable through the MNE-Scan application.
