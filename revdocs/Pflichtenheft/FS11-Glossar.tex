	\item[MNE-CPP ??????]
	\item[Real-Time] describes the circumstance of an ongoing input which is computed directly with low latency.
	
	\item[MEG/EEG ??????] 
	\item[SCDC, Geodesic Problem ??????]
	\item[Vertex] is a point, in a n-dimensional space, where two or more lines or edges meet .
	\item[Mesh]	contains a number of vertices and edges, forming a 3D shape. Often these vertices and edges are structured as 					triangles.	
	\item[Euclidian Distance] is the shortest distance between two points in a 3D area.
	\item[Interpolation] is the mathematical construction of new data points within a given set of data points.
	\item[Bad Channels] are sensor inputs that don't deliver working signals or are not set up correctly.
	\item[GPU-Level]
	\item[Compute Shader] are shaders in OpenGL or Direct3D. They can execute calculations outside the typical rendering 								  pipeline, thus parallelization is possible.
	\item[Qt] is a cross-platform framework, mainly used for software applications and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). 
	\item[Eigen (falls im Dokument verwendet wird ?)]
	\item[Efficiency] describes an economical usage of resources. Low storage consumption and small GPU workload are optimal 					  	  for the system.
	\item[Sturdiness] is the ability of the system to function properly and without failures even under non-optimal 								  circumstances. 
	\item[Reliability]
	\item[Security]
	\item[Portability]
