\section{Result of the Planning}
A big part of the first phase of the Project (i.e. Scheduling and Draft) is reflected on the functional specification document. The requirement analyses is registered, the objectives are declared, whereas the decisions and the product informations are written down.

\subsection{Software Development Model}

This section contains information about the Software model chosen based on the Requirements of the Project.
The Principals of the Group, the Customer Requirement and Knowledge about the Project play an important role in choosing the Development Model. Based on the Development Model, the Development team decides its work flow. 

\begin{description}
	\leftskip=0,8cm
	\item[Agile Development Model: SCRUM] The Group chose Scrum because it is an iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing product development. The duration of each Sprint would be two weeks. Each Phase of the Software Development would have two Sprints. 
	
	Each Sprint would end with a Presentation by each Working Group about the Developments and Progress during the Sprint. The End of each Phase of the Project would be marked by a working Prototype and a Presentation which would include a summary of the work done by the entire team. 
	
	\item[Projects specific Adaptation to the Model:] Every person in the team has multiple roles. Each group member would be working on both, the Document and the Code.
\end{description} 

\subsubsection{Software Development specific Content}
Since the group decided for the Agile Development Project, the Milestones need to be stated and agreed upon by the Team. Milestones are the Aim or the expected output of each Development Phase. The also give the Outlook and Perspective of the Performance of the System. They help the team to specify what all should be completed by which deadline.

\subsection{Effort estimate}
The main purpose in the effort estimation section is the categorization of the different parts of the Project regarding their complexity and effort criteria.

\subsection{Risk Estimation RE}
In this section, the probability of the different occurring risks involved in the Project is mentioned. If any risks take place, their effect helps determining how important it is for the team to take care of that risk and prevent it from happening again.

\subsection{Organization}

This section concerns to the rules, agreements and the partitioning regarding the teamwork in the Project, so the work itself will at it best be efficient and organized.
