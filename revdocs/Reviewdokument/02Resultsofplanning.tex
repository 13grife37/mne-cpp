\subsection{Result of Planning}
A large part of the first phase of the project (i.e. scheduling and draft) is reflected on the functional specification document. The requirement analysis is registered, the objectives are declared, whereas the decisions and the product information is written down.

\subsubsection{Software Development Model}

This section contains information about the software model chosen, based on the requirements of the project.
The principals of the group, client requirement and knowledge about the project play an important role in choosing the development model. Based on the latter, the development team decides its work flow. 

\begin{aims}
	\leftskip=0,8cm
	\item[Agile Development Model: SCRUM] The group chose SCRUM because it is an iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing product development. The duration of each sprint was set to two weeks. Each phase of the software development has two sprints. 
	
	Every sprint ends with a presentation by the relevant working group about the developments and progress during the sprint. The end of the respective phase of the project is marked by a working prototype and a presentation which includes a summary of the work done by the entire team. 
	
	\item[Projects specific adaptation to the model:] Every person in the team has multiple roles. All group members work on both the document and the code.
\end{aims} 

\paragraph{Software Development Specific Content}
Since the group decided for the agile development project, the milestones need to be stated and agreed upon by the team. Milestones are the aim or the expected output of each development phase. They help the team to specify what features should be completed by which deadline.

\subsubsection{Effort Estimate}
The main purpose in the effort estimation section is the categorization of the different parts of the project regarding their complexity and effort criteria.  
 (see figure 1)

\subsubsection{Risk Estimate}
In this section, the probabilities of the different risks involved in the project are listed. This will help the team to determine what aspects of the implementation should get a higher priority.

\begin{description}
	\item[RE1:] Communication problems in the team
	\item[RE2:] Coverage is too extensive
	\item[RE3:] Framework does not provide the needed functionality 
	\item[RE4:] Resource bottleneck derived from team members temporary absence 
	\item[RE5:] Change of the requirements due to miscommunication with the product owner 
	\item[RE6:] Hidden complexity 
	\item[RE7:] Acceptable computation time takes a lot more effort than expected  
\end{description}

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Handling Risks}

In case one of the risks occurs, certain strategies for solving the issue are provided. Only the ones having a crucial impact on the project are dealt with in the following section. 

\begin{aims}
	
	\item[RE2:]Optional requirements will only be addressed after every mandatory criteria is fulfilled.
	\item[RE6:]The team communicates with the product owners to eradicate all ambiguities.
	\item[RE7:]To keep the computation time as low as possible, changes to the software will be tested constantly to 						   determine even minor impacts on efficiency. 	
	
\end{aims}
