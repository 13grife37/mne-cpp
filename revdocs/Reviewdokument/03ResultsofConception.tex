\section{Results of Design}

The results of design can be found in the preliminary design document.
The connections between different packages, components and classes are explained and visualized using UML-diagrams. 

\subsection{Tools} 

The used tools are programs which facilitate the different aspects of the organization and development.

\subsubsection{Organization Tools}
	\begin{aims}
		
		\item[Code versioning:] The source code will be managed via \textit{Git} to ensure a convenient exchange and tracking of code.
		
		\item[LaTeX:] \textit{LaTeX} is used for editing review documents and documentation.
		
		\item[Doxygen:] This program will automatically document source code comments.
		
		\item[Visual Paradigm:] Used for creating UML-diagrams and other aspects of visual documentation. 
	\end{aims}

\subsubsection{Developing Tools}
	\begin{aims}
		
		\item[Development environment:] Since it is already established within MNE-CPP, \textit{QtCreator} will be used for code editing and compiling.
		
		\item[Program language:] \textit{C++} will be used hence it is the main language of MNE-CPP 
		\item[Operating systems:] The software will be developed on Linux and Microsoft Windows.
		
		\item[Libraries:] Besides standard libraries from the C++ 11 standard, the MNE-CPP framework is based on Eigen, OpenGL and Qt.
		
	\end{aims}

\subsection{Results of first iteration design:}
The results of the first iteration correlate with the respective milestone. 
\begin{aims}
	\leftskip=0,8cm
		\item[Functional specification:] The requirements specification is transferred into the corresponding functional specification.
		
	    \item[Preliminary design:] The preliminary design includes a first overview of the main features and structure (see preliminary design document).
		\item[Implementation:] A first executable prototype is created.
		
		\item[Planning:] Milestones for the next iteration are declared.
				
	\end{aims}

\subsection{Tasks for next iteration}

\begin{aims}
	\leftskip=0,8cm
	\item[Refining the preliminary design:] The preliminary design is extended with diagrams and more detailed descriptions. This will be done according to milestones progress.
		
		\item[Further implementation:] The mentioned features will be implemented and tested.
