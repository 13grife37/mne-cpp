\section{Introduction}
The review document grants insight into the progress of the project and covers the decisions the team made during development.

It serves as an extension to the design and developer documents, which describe the structure and code of the software in more detail.

The document is divided into three segments, each representing a phase of the project. 
Each phase stands for specific tasks and gives a time frame for when they have to be finished.

Thus, after every phase progress gets documented and reflected and a lookout for further work on the project is provided.
