\section{Goals of the second pPhase}
In this section the goals for the following phase are outlined. 

\subsection{Testing of SCDC}
The correctness of the SCDC-feature has to be tested in order to guarantee realistic results. Additionally if any possibility to optimize the speed of the SCDC comes up, the performance will be improved further.
\subsection{Testing of Projecting}
If any other data-structure will be used, the results can be checked via comparing them to the ones gained by the linear search.
\subsection{Portation to MNE Scan}
The MNE Scan application is the front-end in which the features ultimately should be integrated. In this phase we aim to achieve this concomitant with the completion of the features.
\subsection{Optimization of the Interpolation}
