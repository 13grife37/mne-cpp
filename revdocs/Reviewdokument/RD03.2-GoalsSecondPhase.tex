\subsection{Goals for Third Phase}
In this section the goals for the following phase are outlined. 

\subsubsection{Testing of SCDC}
The correctness of the SCDC-feature has to be tested in order to guarantee realistic results. Additionally if any possibility to optimize the speed of the SCDC comes up, the performance will be improved further.
\subsubsection{Testing of Projecting}
If any other data-structure will be used, the results can be checked via comparing them to the ones gained by the linear search.
\subsubsection{Portation to MNE Scan}
The MNE Scan application is the front-end in which the features ultimately should be integrated. In this phase we aim to achieve this concomitant with the completion of the features.
\subsubsection{Optimization of the Interpolation}
Interpolating the sensor data works quite well at this point of time. In the upcoming phase we try to further improve its performance via using compute shaders. This could speed up the calculation as well as it has the advantage of having the data already on the graphics card for further output.
\subsubsection{Bad Channels}
\subsubsection{Fibonacci Heap}
