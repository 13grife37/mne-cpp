\subsection{Bugreview}
Due to encountering some problems during implementation, not all features are finished and ready for testing.
Nevertheless we were able to fix the majority of the occurring issues. \\ 
The following aspects and features need further processing in phase three. 

\subsubsection{Missing Feature}
Until the end of the project this feature has to be implemented and tested.

\begin{aims}
	\item[Integration into Disp3D]
\end{aims}

\subsubsection{Missing Mandatory Functions}
These functions are mandatory and thus have to be completed in the third phase.

\begin{aims}
	\item[Bad Channels]Sometimes sensors do not deliver correct data and are marked as bad channels. These sensors should not have                          					   any impact on the weight matrix and the following interpolation. 
	
					   Currently this information is not utilized during computation. Therefore misleading data is used and the 							   results are not completely correct.   
\end{aims}

\subsubsection{Missing Optional Functions}
After finishing the implementation of all mandatory functions these extensions are to be considered.

\begin{aims}
	\item[Computation on GPU]To further increase the efficiency of the interpolation, calculations should be done using compute                							 shaders, utilizing the GPU. This would allow faster interpolation cycles.
	\item[Reconsider KD-Tree for Mapping]
	\item[Portation to MNE Scan]
\end{aims}
