\subsection{Results of Second Phase}
In this sections the achievements of the second phase are documented.
\begin{aims}
	\item[\hspace*{11mm} Detailed Design:]A document for the detailed design of the software was created.
	 It covers implemented classes and their structures, while giving explanations for all functions and components. \\
	 Further design choices made during development are described.

\end{aims}

\begin{aims}	
	\item[\hspace*{11mm} Developer Documentation:]A developer documentation was created by using Doxygen. It is available as a separate document.   
\end{aims}

\begin{aims}
	\item[\hspace*{11mm} Implementation:]Implementations of the first phase were continued and refined. 
	The first three major features are operational and optimized to a certain degree. \\
	This results in computation times within the limits of agreements with the product owners.\\
	 The software is able to project sensors onto a surface, calculate the distances of vertices on a mesh and create  the weight matrix for later interpolation, which is also implemented and runnable. 
\end{aims}

\begin{aims}	
	\item[\hspace*{11mm} Planning:]All remaining tasks are known and next steps for the coming iteration were discussed within the team.
