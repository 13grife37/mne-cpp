\item [Bad channels] are sensor inputs that do not deliver working signals or are not set up correctly.
\item [Compute shaders] are a shader type in OpenGL. They allow for custom computations to be executed outside the typical rendering pipeline.
\item [Disp3D] is a part of the MNE-CPP framework that holds 3D visualization functionality.
\item[Eigen] is a C++ template library for linear algebra that includes matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms
\item [Fibonacci Heap] is a data structure for priority queue operations, consisting of a collection of heap-ordered trees.
\item [GPU] (graphics processing unit) is a programmable logic chip specialized for display functions.
\item [Linear search] or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list.
\item [MNE-CPP] is a cross-platform C++ framework, which provides MEG/EEG tools and applications for fast non-invasive brain monitoring.
\item [OpenGL] is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.
\item [Qt] is a cross-platform framework, mainly used for software applications and graphical user interfaces.
\item [SCDC] (surface constrained distance calculation) determines the shortest path between two points on a tessellated surface.
\item[k-D Tree] is a special type of binary search tree for organizing some number of points in k dimensions.
