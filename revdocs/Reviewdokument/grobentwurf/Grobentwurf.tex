\section{Basic structure of MNE-CPP}

MNE-CPP is a framework of tools and programs to analyze and work with MEG/EEG data.

\section{Integration of the product into MNE-CPP}

The realtime mesh utilities are to be integrated into the structure of the MNE-CPP framework. Too provide a versatile interface, the utilities are organized inside a package within the library layer (see Figure 1).

Later on, the features are to be ported to MNE-Scan (see section 1).

\section{Subdivision of program features}

\begin{description}
	
	\item[SCDC] 
	The surface constrained distance calculation algorithm receives a mesh data set as its input, which is stored inside a file. It then calculates approximate distances between vertices. When no further input arguments are provided, the SCDC algorithm calculates a full distance table, that is the distance between any vertex to any other vertex.
	When it receives a subset of the vertices as an additional argument, it only calculates the distances from said subset to every other vertex of the mesh. The SCDC algorithm stores its results inside a two-dimensional matrix.
	
	\item[Projecting]
	The projecting algorithm maps MEG/EEG-sensors to vertices of the mesh. In case of MEG-sensors, the orientation is known and thus a radial projection is applied in order to assign each sensor to a vertex. In case of EEG-sensors, the orientation is not know and a nearest-neighbor algorithm is used.
	The projecting algorithm then outputs the results of the calculation as an array of indices, which point to the respective vertices of the mesh.
	
	\item[Interpolation]
	The interpolation algorithm uses the results of both the projecting algorithm and the SCDC algorithm.
	Based on the distance table, it calculates a weight matrix for the later live interpolation. 
	Thus the interpolation algorithm receives three different inputs: the distance table created by SCDC, the sensors mapping and the actual sensor input, i.e. brain activity recorded by sensors over a period of time.
	The recorded brain activity gets passed to the interpolation algorithm either from an ongoing MME/EEG-Scan or a prerecorded data set, i.e. a file. 
	
	\item[Disp3D]
	In order to provide control over aspects of the interpolation within the MNE-CPP framework, a new function is added to the Disp3D tree model.
		
\end{description}

By dividing the realtime mesh utilities into the mentioned components, internal changes and extensions are easy to implement. Added to that, the single components can be reused elsewhere within the MNE-CPP framework.
