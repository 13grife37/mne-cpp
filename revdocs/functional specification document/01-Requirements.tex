\section{Requirements}
The product receives EEG/MEG sensor data and constructs a real-time 3D visualization of the brains current activities.

\subsection{Mandatory criteria}
The following functions have to be implemented correctly and fulfill given requirements.
\subsubsection{Surface constrained distance calculation( geodesic problem on meshes)}
The function receives input data, preprocessed by the software environment, structured as a triangulated surface mesh.%vll anders formulieren 
 The mesh can contain up to 200,000 vertices.
\begin{description}
	\item[1] Based on that data, the function calculates a matrix that holds values describing the distance between all selected vertices. 
\end{description}
